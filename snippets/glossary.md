- **Client** - A device or session that is used by a user or bot to connect to a server.
- **Federation token** - A one-time use token generated by a user's home server, which is used to authorize/identify a user on a foreign server.
- **Foreign client** - From a server perspective, any client authenticated on the server, where the client would not view the server as its home server.
- **Foreign server** - A polyproto-core server that a user is not registered on - essentially a third party.
- **Home client** - From a server perspective, any client registered on the server, where the client would view the server as its home server.
- **Home server** - The server that a user is registered on. Any polyproto-core compliant server hosted on the same domain is also considered a home server.
- **Identity Key** - A key pair which represents a user's identity for a given session. It is used to sign messages and to encrypt messages for the user.
- **polyproto** - The combination of the polyproto-core and polyproto-chat protocols and APIs.
