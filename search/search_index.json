If the join request is accepted by any member, that member will initiate the MLS welcoming process. If the member finds that the join request is invalid (perhaps due to an invalid <code>KeyPackage</code>), the join request must be denied. It is imperative that join requests are verified correctly by the server.</p> <p> Text Only<pre><code>     Charlie                                        Server                                            Alice                         Bob\n     |                                              |                                                 |                             |\n     | Channel join request + KeyPackage            |                                                 |                             |\n     |---------------------------------------------&gt;|                                                 |                             |\n     |                                              |                                                 |                             |\n     |                                              | Notify group of join request                    |                             |\n     |                                              |-----------------------------------              |                             |\n     |                                              |                                  |              |                             |\n     |                                              |&lt;----------------------------------              |                             |\n     |                                              |                                                 |                             |\n     |                                              | Channel join request + Charlie's KeyPackage     |                             |\n     |                                              |------------------------------------------------&gt;|                             |\n     |                                              |                                                 |                             |\n     |                                              |                                                 | Verify Charlie's KeyPackage |\n     |                                              |                                                 |------------------------     |\n     |                                              |                                                 |                       |     |\n     |                                              |                                                 |&lt;-----------------------     |\n     |                                              |                                                 |                             |\n     |                                              |             Notify group of new member: Charlie |                             |\n     |                                              |&lt;------------------------------------------------|                             |\n     |                                              |                                                 |                             |\n     |                                              |                           Encrypted MLS Welcome |                             |\n     |                                              |&lt;------------------------------------------------|                             |\n     |                                              |                                                 |                             |\n     |                                              | Forward: Notify group of new member: Charlie    |                             |\n     |                                              |------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;|\n     |                                              |                                                 |                             |\n     | Forward: Notify group of new member: Charlie |                                                 |                             |\n     |&lt;---------------------------------------------|                                                 |                             |\n     |                                              |                                                 |                             |\n     |               Forward: encrypted MLS Welcome |                                                 |                             |\n     |&lt;---------------------------------------------|                                                 |                             |\n     |                                              |                                                 |                             |\n</code></pre> Fig. 3: Sequence diagram of a successful encrypted channel join in which Alice acts as a gatekeeper.

This is a problem, as the malicious server can then impersonate the user on another server, as well as read unencrypted data (such as messages, in the context of a chat application) sent on the other server.</p> <p>The above scenario is not unique to polyproto-core, and rather a problem other federated services/ protocols, like ActivityPub, have as well. There is no real solution to this problem, but it can be mitigated a bit by making it more difficult for malicious home servers to do something like this without the user noticing.</p> <p>Polyproto servers should notify users, when a new session token is generated for them. This would make the malicious home server's actions more noticeable to the user. However, this does not address the issue of the malicious home server being able to generate a federation token for a server which you are not yet connected to, as the user would have no way to receive the notification of a  session token being created for them, if they are not connected to that server. Clients re-connecting to a server after being offline should be notified of any new session tokens that were generated for them while they were offline. This <code>NEW_SESSION</code> gateway event should be sent to all sessions, except for the new session. The <code>NEW_SESSION</code> gateway event should contain the following information:</p> JSON<pre><code>{\n  \"ip\": \"&lt;IP address of the session&gt;\",\n  \"user_agent\": \"&lt;User agent of the session&gt;\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"&lt;Timestamp of when the session was created&gt;\",\n  \"session_pubkey\": \"&lt;Public key of the session&gt;\",\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>With proper safety precautions and strong encryption, it is extremely unlikely for a malicious server to be able to listen in on encrypted conversations, without all users in that  conversation noticing. MLS's forward secrecy guarantees ensure that, in theory, a malicious session cannot decrypt any messages sent before its' join epoch.

Consider the following example which employs foreign server public identity key caching, but no home server issued identity key certificates:</p> <p>Potential abuse scenario</p> <p>A malicious foreign server B can fake a message from Alice (Home server: Server A) to Bob (Home Server: Server B), by generating a new identity key pair and using it to sign the malicious message. The foreign server then sends that message to Bob, who will then request Alice's public identity key from Server B, who will then send Bob the malicious public identity key. Bob will succeed in verifying the signature of the message, and not notice that the message is malicious.</p> <p>The above scenario is not possible with home server issued identity key certificates, as the malicious server cannot generate an identity key pair for Alice which is signed by Server A.</p> <p>Should the expected lifetime of a servers' identity key come to an early end, perhaps due to being leaked and therefore needing to be rotated, the server should generate a new identity key pair + ID-Cert and send a <code>SERVER_KEY_CHANGE</code> gateway event, as well as a <code>LOW_KEY_PACKAGES</code> event to all clients. The clients should then also re-generate their identity keys and request a new ID-Cert from the server (via sending a CSR), as well as respond to the <code>LOW_KEY_PACKAGES</code> event correctly.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>A <code>LOW_KEY_PACKAGES</code> event is only sent by servers which use MLS encryption.

This key pair is used to represent a user's identity and to verify message integrity, by having a user sign all messages they send with their private identity key. The key pair is generated by the user, and a user-generated identity key certificate signing request (CSR) is sent to the user's home server when first connecting to the server with a new client, or when rotating keys. The key is stored in the client's local storage. Upon receiving a new identity key CSR, a home server will sign this CSR and send the resulting public key certificate to the client. This certificate is proof that the home server attests to the clients key.

This is done by generating a new identity key pair, and sending the new public identity key to their home server, as part of a new Certificate Signing Request, at least one new <code>KeyPackage</code> and one corresponding 'last resort' <code>KeyPackage</code>. The home server will then generate the new ID-Cert, send it to the client, and let all clients with a relationship to the client that rotated their identity key know, that this clients' public identity key has changed. The server does this by sending a <code>CLIENT_KEY_CHANGE</code> gateway event to those clients. For example, in the context of a chat application built with polyproto-chat, a relationship between two clients exists, if the two clients share a guild, a group or a direct message channel, if they are friends, or if they have a pending friend request between each other.</p> <p>Before sending any messages to a server, a client that performed a key rotation should inform the server of that change, to ensure that the server has the correct ID-Cert cached for the client.</p> <p>Home servers must keep track of the ID-Certs of all users (and their clients) registered on them, and must be able to provide a clients' ID-Cert for a given timestamp on request. This is to ensure messages sent by users, even ones sent a long time ago, can be verified by other servers and their users. This is because the public key of a user may change over time and users must sign all messages they send to servers. Likewise, a client should also keep all of its own ID-Certs stored perpetually, to potentially verify its identity in case of a migration.</p> <p>Signing messages prevents a malicious foreign server from impersonating a user.</p>"},{"location":"Protocol%20Specifications/core/#722-message-verification","title":"7.2.2 message verification","text":"<p>Of course, in order for message signing to actually verify message integrity, clients must verify the signatures of all messages they receive.

is not needed for the migration, why try to contact it in the first place?</p> <p>It is generally preferrable to have the old home server cooperate with the migration, as it allows for a more seamless migration. A cooperative homeserver will be able to provide the new home server with all information associated with the old account. It can also forward requests regarding the old account to the new server, which makes the process more seamless for other users.

The process requires some coordination between the new and old accounts,  and can only be initiated by the old account. </p> <p>To initiate the process, the old account must send an API request to the server where messages should be re-signed. The request must contain the federation ID of the new account. The server will  then respond with a list of all keys that were used to sign messages sent by the old account. The old account will then need to prove that it is in possession of the private keys that were used to sign the messages. This is done by signing a challenge string with the private keys. The server will then verify the signature, and, if the verification is successful, grant the new account the ability to re-sign all messages sent by the old account which were signed with the provided keys.</p> <p>Re-signing messages mustn't overwrite the old signature.
