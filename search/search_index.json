This is a problem, as the malicious server can then impersonate the user on another server, as well as read unencrypted text messages sent on the other server.</p> <p>The above scenario is not unique to polyproto-core, and rather a problem other federated services/ protocols, like ActivityPub, have as well. There is no real solution to this problem, but it can be mitigated a bit by making it more difficult for malicious home servers to do something like this without the user noticing.</p> <p>Polyproto servers should notify users (even guest users), when a new session token is generated for them. This would make the malicious server's actions more noticeable to the user. However, this does not address the issue of the malicious server being able to generate a federation token for a server which you are not yet connected to. Clients who re-connect to a server after being offline should be notified of any new session tokens that were generated for them while they were offline.

is not needed for the migration, why try to contact it in the first place?</p> <p>It is generally preferrable to have the old home server cooperate with the migration, as it allows for a more seamless migration. A cooperative homeserver will be able to provide the new home server with all information and data (like uploads) associated with the old account. It can also forward requests regarding the old account to the new server, which makes the process more seamless for other users. The \"non-cooperative homeserver migration method\" is only a last resort.</p> <p>TODO</p> <p>TODO: The previous section mentions \"migrating account uploads\". This needs clarification</p>"},{"location":"specification/#72-re-signing-messages","title":"7.2 Re-signing messages","text":"<p>Re-signing messages is the process of transferring ownership of messages from an old account to the new, migrated account. The process requires some coordination between the new and old accounts,  and can only be initiated by the old account. </p> <p>To initiate the process, the old account must send an API request to the server where messages should be re-signed. The request must contain the federation ID of the new account. The server will  then respond with a list of all keys that were used to sign messages sent by the old account. The old account will then need to prove that it is in possession of the private keys that were used to sign the messages. This is done by signing a challenge string with the private keys. The server will then verify the signature, and, if the verification is successful, grant the new account the ability to re-sign all messages sent by the old account which were signed with the provided keys.</p> <p>Re-signing messages mustn't overwrite the old signature.
