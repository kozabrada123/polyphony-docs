All API endpoints needed for implementing polyproto-auth.
This Page only includes routes which a client can request from its home server. For routes which
can also be accessed from a foreign server, or with no authentication at all, see the
[Client-Foreign Server API documentation](../Client-Foreign%20Server%20API/index.md)
