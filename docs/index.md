# Polyphony

This documentation currently hosts information about polyproto; an advanced, secure and scalable
protocol for federated chat services.

The core of the protocol lies in the [polyproto-core specification](./Protocol%20Specifications/core.md) and in the
federation API routes, which are used to negotiate and establish connections between foreign servers
and clients.

The polyproto-core federation protocol can be used for any kind of online service, enabling you to
bring federated identities to your federated social network, federated chat service or federated
$ANYTHING.
