# docs
Specification documents and API documentation for the polyproto federated messaging protocol
Built with mkdocs-material and python3.10

## File structure

The `/docs` folder has the specification documents for the polyproto protocol. The `docs/APIs` folder houses the API documentation for the polyproto-core and polyphony-chat reference implementation.

The `/snippets` folder has snippets of text used in many places in the documentation. This is to ensure consistency across the documentation. Error messages appearing in many places are also stored in the `/snippets/errors` folder.

## Contributing

The best way to contribute is to open an issue if you find any problems with the documentation. Creating an issue is generally the best way to contribute to any open source project, as it allows the maintainers to discuss the issue and come to a consensus on how to fix it.
